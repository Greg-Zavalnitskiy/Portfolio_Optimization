# Portfolio Optimization Project
This project aims to develop a more advanced and effective model for portfolio optimization, building upon the methods discussed in the book "Financial Signal Processing and Machine Learning" edited by Ali N. Akansu, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, and Dmitry Malioutov.

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from the need to explore and develop more robust and efficient models for portfolio optimization. The book discusses various methods for portfolio optimization, including linear programming models. However, as optimization techniques and machine learning methods continue to advance, there is a need to incorporate recent advances in these areas to develop even more advanced and effective models.

# Goals
The main goals of this project are:

To develop an optimization model that accounts for dividend yields, expected returns, and risk constraints.
To explore and incorporate recent advances in optimization techniques and machine learning methods.
To compare the performance of the new model with existing models, such as the Markowitz portfolio.
# Methodology
The project will use Python and various optimization libraries, such as CVXPY, to develop and test the new optimization model. The model will be evaluated using historical stock data and compared with existing models to assess its performance.

# Conclusion
Overall, this project aims to contribute to the development of more advanced and effective models for portfolio optimization. By incorporating recent advances in optimization techniques and machine learning methods, we hope to develop a model that can outperform existing models and provide better results for investors.
